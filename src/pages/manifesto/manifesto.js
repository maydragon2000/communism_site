            </h5>
            <p>
              Greetings, comrades of the digital age! Tired of Capitalist Ponzi
              tokenomics? With $COMMUNISM, all you need to do is hold the token
              in your wallet, and claim your ETH when your timer is at 0. Buying
              and Selling increases your claim time and when you claim there is
              a chance to double it or claim half. The Funds come from the token
              trading fees, and our revenue generating communist ventures. No
              staking, just claim your ETH comrade.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>100 Million $COMMUNISM will ever exist</p>
            <p>
              Communism.network is not merely a blockchain project; it is the
              digital vanguard of the proletariat! True to the tenets of
              revolutionary communism, the Party (our valiant developers) holds
              but a nominal 12% of the total token supply, strictly earmarked
              for operational fortitude and forging global socialist alliances
              (yes, that means exchange listings), as well as burns for
              takeovers.

            <h5>The Great Leap Forward in Redistribution!</h5>
            <br />
            <p>
              Forget the outdated cries of seizing mere means of production; we
              are here to seize the means of redistribution!

            <p>6% Mandated Tax of All Transactions</p>
            <p>
              5% : $COMMUNISM Proletarian Dividend: Each transaction generously
              redistributes wealth back to the proletariat ($COMMUNISM holders).
              This is your digital bread ration, comrades, and it arrives at the
              end of the claim period. This will rise to become the full
              allocation of the taxes and will be voted on by the people before
              the contract is renounced.

              1% : People's Tax for Revolutionary Propaganda: A minuscule tithe
              for the grand cause, allocated to amplify our revolutionary
              message across the blockchain and beyond! This will only be 1% to
              develop a war chest to fight the revolution.

            <h5>The People's Assembly: FAQs </h5>
            <br />
            <p>Q1: The Socialist Method of Earning ETH? </p>
            <p>
              A: It is simple comrade. You hold $COMMUNISM, when your timer on
              the dashboard reaches 0, you claim your share of ETH. Do it as
              quickly as possible each time.
            </p>
            <p>Q2: The Five-Year Blockchain Plans?</p>
            <p>
              A: We will take over the world. We will buy land, build schools,
              spread the warmth of the red sea around the world until we have
              seized the entire monetary system.
            </p>
            <p>Q3: A Presale, the Bourgeoisie's Folly?</p>
            <p>
              A: Never. Capitalist illusion of exclusivity. Here, every comrade
              can participate equally in a fair launch.
            </p>
            <p>Q4: The Inner Workings of the People's Treasury?</p>
            <p>
              A: Hold a mere 1% of $COMMUNISM tokens, and you can claim 1 ETH
              from a treasury of 100 ETH. But beware, claiming reduces the
              treasury, making each successive claim slightly smaller. For
              example, if another person has 1% but claims after the first
              person mentioned, then there will be 99 ETH left in the pool and
              the second user will be claiming 1% of 99 ETH, resulting in a
              claim of .99 ETH.
            </p>
            <p>Q5: The Consequences of Missing a Claim?</p>
            <p>
              A: Ah, fear not, comrade! You will not be reprimanded for missing
              a claim. Your ETH will still be available to you when you return
              to your station. But beware the prize pool will diminish as your
              comrades claim their rewards. Keep in mind claims do NOT stack.
            </p>
            <p>Q8: Why Might My Claim Be Reduced Today?</p>
            <p>
              A: The more our comrades claim, the less remains for the
              collective. Be vigilant, claim early, and claim often to maximize
              your share!
            </p>
            <p>Q9: The Dire Cost of Selling Tokens?</p>
            <p>
              A: To sell is to betray the revolution, comrade! Such treachery
              shall not go unpunishedâ€”if you sell all of your holdings, your
              next claim date shall be pushed into the distant future, by 50
              years time. If you only sell a portion, your claim becomes delayed
              by 1 hour.
            </p>
            <p>Q11: How shall the Party Sustain the Revolution?</p>
            <p>
              A: The fees are just the spark to the $COMMUNIST fire that will
              burn its light for eternity. We will embark on revenue generating
              ventures that go directly to the claim pool immediately at launch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The Act of Claiming</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Proceed to our People's Dashboard and authenticate your digital
              identity by connecting your wallet.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Your claimable ETH will be displayed in all its glory, based on
              your share of the $COMMUNISM supply.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>How and Where to Procure $COMMUNISM</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              $COMMUNISM shall be available for the masses on the Ethereum
              mainnet via the people's platform, Uniswap. Beware of capitalist
              imposters and always authenticate the smart contract address. Your
              contributions fortify the revolution!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ensure your digital wallet is abundant in ETH, not merely for
              transactional purposes but to fuel the ceaseless fire of our
              revolution!
            </p>

              Purge Red Reserve : In order to make our glorious economy function

              to do their part and poke the system. By committing yourself to
              the cause you allow the bread lines to open and allow for
              redistribution to reach your comrade friends! Whoever successfully
              purges the red reserve will be rewarded with 2% of the total pool.
